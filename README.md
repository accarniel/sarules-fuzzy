# Overview

We propose a novel method to **extract spatial association rules from fuzzy spatial data**. The innovation of our method relies on adequately handling spatial fuzziness by using fuzzy spatial objects and fuzzy topological relationships.

This repository will contain the implementation of an application that shows how our method works.

For this, we employ the R package [fsr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fsr) and real spatial datasets available in public repositories.

We are working on to make this implementation publicly available.
